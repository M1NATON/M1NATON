# Hey, friends! ðŸŒŸ

My name is Arsen, I'm 20 years old, and I'm glad to see you on my GitHub page! ðŸš€

## About Me

I'm a fun guy who knows how to Google. In my free time, I love watching movies and cartoons. My favorite trilogy is "How to Train Your Dragon," and my favorite movie is "Interstellar." If we're talking about cars, my dream car is the Porsche 911 Boxster.

## Technologies

I write frontend using the following technologies:
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **RTK Query**

But I'm always open to learning new tools and technologies!
